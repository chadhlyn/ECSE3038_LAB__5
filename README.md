For this lab, three LEDs should be connected to the ESP32 board's digital output pins. To control the current and guard against LED damage, add a resistor to each LED. Make a two-dimensional array with the LEDs in the required state. Your array must include at least 8 inner arrays, each of which must have 3 Boolean values. The desired state of each LED can be digitally written by iterating through your array using a for loop. After all three LEDs' statuses have been set, a PUT request should be sent. After each request, pause for at least two seconds.
